# Credits

I feel that I should give a shoutout to folks whose configs saved me from a lot headaches:

- [xeji](https://github.com/xeji01) for topbar and app launcher inspiration and fastfetch config;

- [Vince](https://github.com/vinceliuice) for their amazing GTK configuration;

- [zDyant](https://github.com/zDyant) for swaync inspiration.
